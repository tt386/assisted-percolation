The indea of this script is to see how the probability of mutant domination varies with both Mutant Fitness and the area fraction of the patches, whch are distributed randomly. This would then be compared against a theoretical prediction.

This is very similar to the lattice behaviour, except here each repeat has a different distribution of randomly placed obstacles. For each distribution, we sub-repeat this system until we get enough mutants for it to count as a repeat
